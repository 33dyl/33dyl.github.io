## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 5, part 1
This is one of my favorite labs, as in part 1 we are including an input and output stream header file,
while also connecting to another supplied header file. I found it fun because we were able to create
an input and output string of texts, while also calculating the area of the given rectangle size. We
were also able to create an if statement that if the given measurements were above zero, then calculate
the area by length multiplied by width.

Lab 11, part 1
This is another favorite lab of mine because we were able to open a CSV file as an input, and return it
as a 2D vector of strings. We were also able to create a class that included two constructors: one
taking the name, population, and land_area as arguments, and the other being a default constructor that
initializes our population and land_area to 0. Overall, we learned how to create a program that can read
a CSV file containing state data and populate a vector of state objects for further analysis.

Lab 12, part 1
In this lab, we were able to create an animated GIF image by using the GraphicsMagick library. Our program
checks command-line arguments, creates a lookup table of sine values for generating an animated gradient
effect, and it combines the images into one file. This was very interesting as we had to use new functions
that we hadnâ€™t learned from previous labs.
